# MATER_RASC-AL_2025
This is the publicly avaliable GitHub Repository for the Illinois Space Society's 2025 RASC-AL project: Mars Architecture for Technology Evaluation and Research (MATER). 

# High Level Overview
- Digital_Model
    - This folder contains all the necessary code to run the digital model of MATER the was developed
    - The complete data set of all payload paramters and commands are avliable as .csv files
    - This includes the custom classes for payloads as .py files, the simulator itself as juptyer notebook, and the analysis tools as a juptyer notebook
    - All data sets generated by the model that were used for analysis are also avalibale as .json files

- Mission_Selection
    - This folder contains all the code and data used to complete the trade space analysis
    - The complete data set of all NASA Civil Space Shortfall and science objectives and associated scores are stored in .csv files
    - The complete data set of Analog Payloads are stored in .csv files
    - The code for the implementation of the score function and the differential evolution genetic algorithm are in Jupyter notebooks
    - The code for the convergence and stablity analysis are aviable in Jupyter notebooks

- Payload_Calculations
    - This folder contains miscellaneous hand calulations used for a varitey of payloads
    - Most are in the form of a Jupyter notebook or a .xlsx file
